## Project Overview
This is a simple webapp for tracking Tesla Supercharger visits. The application allows users to:
- Add new supercharger visits with location and date
- View a history of all visited superchargers
- Store data locally in the browser's localStorage

## Technology Stack
- Vite for build tooling and development server
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5 and CSS3
- Local Storage for data persistence

## Code Guidelines
- Use modern JavaScript features (ES6+)
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Implement responsive design principles
- Store data in localStorage for persistence
- Use proper error handling for user inputs
- Follow naming conventions: camelCase for variables and functions

## Key Features to Implement
- Form to add new supercharger visits (location, date, optional notes)
- List/table view of all visits with sorting capabilities
- Data validation for required fields
- Local storage management for data persistence
- Clean, user-friendly interface
